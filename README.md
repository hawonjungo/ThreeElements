# ThreeElements
Mainly learned about OOP. 

A keyboarding game for practicing fast fingers. 

The logic was combining different keys to create multiple skills to kill different monsters, each skill can only kill one type of monster. 
This project was created in year two at college, it hasn't finished yet but overall 70% of the game function have been deployed in the code section, 
However you can only test on the prototype at the moment, seeing how it could look like. Will come back and work on it 'one have free time'
